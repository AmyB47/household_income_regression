# Predicting Median Household Income by U.S. County

**Description**

This project aimed to predict 2019 median household income by US county with a linear regression model using characteristics of the county rather than residents' demographic characteristics. 



**Possible Impacts**

The goal was to create a model for 2019 that could potentially be used with 2020 data inputs available to contribute to understanding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on household income.  This different perspective might contribute to considerations of monetary support needed in the short-term for individuals and families, and also for the long-term outlook of ability to purchase goods and services. Median household income for 2020 will not be published until fall 2021.
